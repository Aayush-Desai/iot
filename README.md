#Problem Statement
There are vast applications of Internet of Things and Machine Learning in the field of Aquaculture. One of the most critical factors in ensuring a healthy and productive livestock is the water suitability to sustain life. With this project, we aim to apply machine learning algorithms to data of parameters of water, mainly, Temperature, pH Level and Turbidity. We study these characteristics and develop a model to predict the suitability based on the data available.

Further details can be found in the Project Report.
